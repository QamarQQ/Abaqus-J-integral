# Abaqus-J-integral
This repository uses python and the Abaqus odb API to calculate the J-integral for specific 3D problems. To do this, shape functions and integration procedures are implemented for the C3D20 element.

# Example 1 - J integral for through thickness crack in infinite plate 

# Example 2 - J integral for compact test specimen with interface
